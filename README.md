# sitl-simulations
Sofware in the loop (SITL) simulations and implementation for my master thesis, using Gazebo, PX4, ROS and QGC.

## Control Module

The control system to steer the vehicles to the desired positions is the one described in [Félix's master thesis][DM_ALF_ENGEL_139928E_Miguel_Félix.pdf](https://github.com/mg-felix/sitl-simulations/files/10230432/DM_ALF_ENGEL_139928E_Miguel_Felix.pdf).


## CV for Target Data Module

The computer vision alorithm used to obtain the target's velocity and position is the one described in [Alves's master thesis](https://github.com/mg-felix/sitl-simulations/files/10230459/DissertacaoMestrado_ASPAL_PILAV_140667-B_Alves.pdf).
