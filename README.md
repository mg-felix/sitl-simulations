# Thesis Material
Sofware in the loop (SITL) simulations code to implement the designed control system in my master thesis.

## Control Module

### mpf_control package

The control system to steer the vehicles to the desired positions is the one described in [FÃ©lix's master thesis](https://github.com/mg-felix/sitl-simulations/files/10230432/DM_ALF_ENGEL_139928E_Miguel_Felix.pdf).


## CV for Target Data Module

### target_geolocation package

The computer vision alorithm used to obtain the target's velocity and position is the one described in [Alves's master thesis](https://github.com/mg-felix/sitl-simulations/files/10230459/DissertacaoMestrado_ASPAL_PILAV_140667-B_Alves.pdf).
